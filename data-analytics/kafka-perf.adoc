We performed the tiered storage testing with three to four nodes for producer and consumer workloads with the NetApp StorageGRID setup. According to our tests, the time to completion and the performance results were directly proportional to the number of StorageGRID nodes. The StorageGRID setup required a minimum of three nodes.

* The time to complete the produce and consumer operation decreased linearly when the number of storage nodes increased.

* The performance for the s3 retrieve operation increased linearly based on number of StorageGRID nodes. StorageGRID supports up to 200 StorgeGRID nodes.
